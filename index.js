// Description
// This time we're going to build a train fare calculator.
// Simple enough, right? We're not looking for something too fancy,
//  but you should be able to input your age and the distance you're travelling
//  and get your ticket price.

// Instructions
// - Ask the user for their age and how far they are travelling (in km)
// - The price per travelled km will be Â£0.21
// - Junior passengers (under 18) get a 20% discount
// - Senior passengers (over 65) get a 40% discount

// Challenge
// We're going to rewrite our program so that the user chooses a starting point
// and a destination from a list of stations, besides inputting their age and then
//  get the ticket price.

// You can come up with the stations' names and distances. Try also to code it so
// that you only need to change the price per km in one place, and all the stations
//  should have the updated price
